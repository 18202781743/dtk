Portal - DTK Documentations & Resources

## Why This Repository Exists

We used to link the DTK documentation directly to <https://linuxdeepin.github.io/dtk>, but then the location of the DTK documentation changed and the original DTK documentation repository was archived to <https://github.com/martyr-deepin/dtk>, making it impossible for those who need to access the DTK documentation to get to any of the documentation through the links in the original source. This repository uses the same name as the original DTK documentation repository and is intended to solve this problem, this project will provide the appropriate pages to link to the DTK documentation and related materials.
